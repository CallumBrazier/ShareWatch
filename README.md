# ShareWatchüçÉ

## Overview
The aim of this project is to create a hub where anyone can login, follow their favourite stocks, and track them on a user-friendly dashboard. <br/>
This will assist them in making informed decisions about which stocks to trade and which to buy. üöÄ

## Stack
This project has been developed using **MongoDB**, **Express**, **React**, and **Node.js**. <br/>
It also utilises the **[Finnhub API](https://finnhub.io/)** to get up-to-date stock and company information.

## Current features
- [x] Register a new-user and log in to your private dashboard.
- [x] The ability to search for US stocks and favourite them.
- [x] Favourite stocks appear on your dashboard.

## In-progress features
- [ ] Drag and drop the cards on your dashboard into a desired order. 
- [ ] Graphing stock movements over time. 
- [ ] Select two stocks and compare them. 

## Potential future featues
- [ ] A forum for different users to discuss stocks. 
- [ ] The ability to search securities from other exchanges outside of the US (e.g. NZX, ASX).
- [ ] The ability to search for cryptocurrencies.
- [ ] Add when a stock was purchased, and how much was purchased, and track your return over-time.

# Deployment
ShareWatch has currently been deployed with Heroku, and can be accessed **[here](https://share-watch.herokuapp.com/)**. <br/>
Note: ShareWatch uses the free-tier of the Finnhub API, which limits API calls to a maximum of 30 calls per second, and up to 60 calls per minute.

# Running Locally
1) First step is to clone this repository into a folder on your local computer. 
2) From the root folder, navigate into the server folder (cd server) and run npm install in the console to download the dependencies. 
2a) Repeat this step, but with the sharewatch folder (cd ../sharewatch from the server folder, or cd sharewatch from the root folder).
3) In the server folder you will need to set-up a .env file to hold your environment variables. 
3a) The first variable is called DB_Connection, which you can get by setting up a new cluster from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
3b) Next you will also need to get an API Key from [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/) and save that as REACT_APP_FH_API_KEY in the .env file.
3c) Lastly, you will need to create a JWT_SECRET in the .env file. This secret code can be anything, but it is recommended that it is generated [here](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). This is used for secure authorisation based on [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction).
4) Once this is complete, you will need to run npm start in both the sharewatch folder and server folder, and navigate to the relevant port on the [localhost](http://localhost:3000).
